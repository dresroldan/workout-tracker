# Workout Tracker

  ## Description:
  As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled. <br>

  When the user is loads the page, they are presented with the Workout Dashboard that displays their last workout logged. The user is also presented with two options.
  The user can either select to 'Continue Workout' to add an exercise to a previous workout plan, or select 'New Workout' to add a new exercise to a new workout plan.
  There is also a 'Dashboard' tab at the top of the page that displays previous exercises and their stats using chart.js.
